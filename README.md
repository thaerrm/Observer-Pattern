PROBLEM:

Many projects may have many relationships that can be jeoprodized or become inactive when one is changed. When subject needs to know update or change an observer, it needs to go through multiple dependencies, to find the relavent information to send out a notification.

SOLUTION:
 
The observer patterns " publish and subscribe " method, allows the object that changes, automatically change its dependents, easily maintaining its consistency. When subject is changed, it sends a notification saying the state has changed, allow the obsevers to call the subject and retrieve the data that has changed.
